## Outline
- What are functions?
- Writing your own functions
- Debugging
- Pitfalls

## Why Functions?
- Reduce the amount of copy & pasting required
    - Reduces the chances of making a mistake
- Let computers do what they do best: repetitive tasks
- Code is more readable

## Functions
- You have used functions in the past like `sum()`, `mean()`, `filter()`
- Under the hood these are powered by lines of R code
- You can see this by going command + click the function name
- Does not work for all functions (i.e. base R)

```{r source, eval = FALSE}
filter()
mean()
```

## Basic Structure

- Define the function
- Specify the inputs, or arguments
- Write the R code which performs the chosen task
- Return the output
```{r structure}
name_of_function <- function(ingredient_1) {
  # Body of your function
  # Where your R code goes
  # "Recipe" goes here
  # Should return the result
}
```

## `r emo::ji("cake")` {.smaller}
<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
### Recipe
Pumpkin Pie `r emo::ji("jack-o-lantern")`

Ingredients:

- Pumpkin
- Egg
- Pie Crust
 
Recipe:

- Preheat the oven to 350 F
- Whisk together pumpkin, egg
- Pour mixture into pie crust
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">
### R code
```{r pie_function}
pumpkin_pie <- function(pumpkin, crust, egg) {
  # 1. Preheat the oven to 350F
  # 2. Whisk together pumpkin, egg
  # 3. Pour mixture into crust
  # Makes a pi - automatically `returns`
  # its result
}
```
</div>

## Example Function for Area 
```{r function_demo}
# Fill in the template
# Variables passed as arguments are referenced in the function's body
# Running it will give you a new function in your environment
tri_area <- function(height, base) {
  height * base / 2
}

tri_area(1, 5)
```

## Rule of Thumb for Implementing Functions

If you need to copy/paste code more than 3 times you should start thinking about
writing a function (DRY principle; **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself)

## Tips for Writing Functions
![](https://stat545.com/img/spotify-howtobuildmvp.jpg)

## General Steps
- Write some working R code
- Put code into the function format
- Test it
- Fix it until it works

## Challenge 1
Write a function that:

- Takes the width, depth and height as inputs
- Calculates the volume of a rectangular prism
- Call your function `vol_rect`

```{r challenge1, include = FALSE}
vol_rect <- function(w, d, h) {
  w * d * h
}

vol_rect(3, 4, 5)
```

## Debugging with Specialized Functions

- `debug()`
- `browser()`
- RStudio "red dot" debugger

## Debugging with Print
```{r print}
debug <- function(height, base){
  1 + 2
  height * base / 2
}
debug(1, 2)

debug2 <- function(height, base) {
  print(1 + 2)
  height * base / 2
}
debug2(1, 2)
```

## Pitfalls

- Tidy Evaluation (we will focus on this)
- Lexical Scoping (look this up later)

## Pitfalls - Tidy Evaluation

Let's look at an example with ggplot2, using the built-in **mtcars** dataset
```{r mtcars_dataset}
data("mtcars")
mtcars
```

## Write a function which contains ggplot2()
Everything looks OK, but if you try to run it, it fails!
```{r error_mtcars, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
# Normal ggplot2 call:
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point()

# Function to perform the above:
multi_graph <- function(cx, cy){
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cx, y = cy)) +
    geom_point()
}

# Try it for yourself!
multi_graph(mpg, wt)
```

## Tidyeval to the Rescue
Solution: Put a {{}} around everything!
```{r tidyeval_demo, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}
multi_graph_2 <- function(cx, cy) {
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = {{cx}}, y = {{cy}})) +
    geom_point()
}
multi_graph_2(mpg, wt)
```

## Challenge 2
Create a function that:

- Will plot a graph of any column in the mtcars dataset
- Saves the box plot under any name given (hint: use `ggsave()`)

```{r challenge2, echo = FALSE}
custom_gg <- function(column1, column2, name) {
  ggplot(mtcars,  aes({{column1}}, {{column2}})) +
    geom_boxplot()
  ggsave(name)
}

custom_gg(mpg, cyl, "new_plot.jpg")
```
