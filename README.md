UBC R Study Group
=======================

Welcome to the UBC R Study Group! We are a group of **R/Python/Julia/(insert
your favourite language)** enthusiasts who love data. We are an inclusive group
and welcome everyone. Check out our [event listings on our
website](http://ubc-r-study-group.github.io/studyGroup/), or join the
conversation on our [message
board](https://github.com/ubc-r-study-group/studyGroup/issues). Our regular
Wednesday sessions are totally open; no sign-up, registration, or fee is
required to attend.

## Information for Summer 2021
There will be no study group sessions held over the summer term, so stay tuned
in here for updates on our plan for Fall 2021. In the meantime, if you have a
question you would like to ask, feel free to find us on our Slack group, or post
your question on our Help Desk, and one of the organizers will try and respond
in a timely manner. Check our [issues
page](https://github.com/UBC-R-Study-group/studyGroup/issues/) to find more
information and links for both of these options. Cheers & stay safe!

## Past Lessons & Schedules
The schedules for past terms and materials for most of our previous lessons are
all available in our
[lessons](https://github.com/UBC-R-Study-group/studyGroup/tree/gh-pages/lessons)
folder, with contents organized by date. See the README within for tables with
all the previous topics for which we have materials posted, to help if you're
looking for a particular topic.

## For Prospective Organizers
**We are always looking for people to lead our sessions!** Drop us a line at
ubcrstudygroup@gmail.com or come to one of our sessions to connect if you are
interested in teaching one of the lessons, or if you'd like to help organize
the study group.

## For Participants
Welcome to our Mozilla Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're
here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch';
 click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email
 notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an
 alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center
 (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the top bar; this is 
 where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space 
 to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi!
  - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by
 a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require
 everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels
 welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under
 the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a
 pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for
 you. Basically, we need the following information:


```
- name: your human name
  affiliation: school, lab, department, business....
  github: your GitHub handle
  interests:
    - list one to three
    - different interests
```
