UBC R Study Group
=======================

Welcome to the UBC R Study Group! We are a group of **R/Python/Julia/(insert
your favourite language)** enthusiasts who love data. We are an inclusive group
and welcome everyone. Check out our [event listings on our
website](http://ubc-r-study-group.github.io/studyGroup/), or join the
conversation on our [message
board](https://github.com/ubc-r-study-group/studyGroup/issues). Our regular
Wednesday sessions are totally open; no sign-up, registration, or fee is
required to attend.

## Schedule
Regular meetings of the UBC R Study Group are held every Wednesday, from 1-2pm.
Please see below for more detailed information for 2021 meet-ups.

Here's our *tentative* schedule for the semester. This might not be the most

## What's a Work-A-Long session?
These sessions are meant as an opportunity for you to come and ask questions or
get help with a programming problem. Bring your code or data, get advice or
tips, and chat with your fellow peers. Just like our other sessions, these are
totally open, no registration needed.

## Help Desk
We have an open [issue](https://github.com/UBC-R-Study-group/studyGroup/issues/102) 
which you can use to post quick questions; one of the organizers should be 
able to respond in a timely manner.

## For Participants
Welcome to our Mozilla Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch';
 click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email
 notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an
 alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center
 (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the top bar; this is 
 where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space 
 to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi!
  - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by
 a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require
 everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels
 welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under
 the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a
 pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for
 you. Basically, we need the following information:


```
- name: your human name
  affiliation: school, lab, department, business....
  github: your GitHub handle
  interests:
    - list one to three
    - different interests
```
